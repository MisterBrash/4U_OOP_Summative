# Part 2 - The Class Diagrams

Your client is not an OOP programmer, they don't know how to create [Class Diagrams](https://www.drawio.com/blog/uml-class-diagrams).
They need you to create the class diagrams for the following objects:
- `Point`
- `LineSegment`
- `Polygon`
- `Triangle`
- `Rectangle`
- _Optional_ `CartesianPlane`

It is recommended that you use [DrawIO](https://app.diagrams.net/). A quick demonstration will be given in class, but there are many other software tools that will work just as well. [Here's a brief overview of class diagrams](https://drawio-app.com/blog/uml-class-diagrams-in-draw-io/).

Keep it simple, we have only learned that properties go on top, methods go below, the `-` `+` and `#` show levels of protection, `/` is an overridden method, and inheritance has an arrow pointing _to the parent_. Look at the example diagrams provided in the lessons _and ask if you're unsure_.

### Submitting

To submit your class diagrams please **export as a picture** (almost any format should work) and include the image in your GitHub Repo. This will also be demonstrated in class.
