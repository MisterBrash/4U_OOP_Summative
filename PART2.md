# Part 2 - The Class Diagrams

Since the client is not an OOP programmer, they don't know how to create [Class Diagrams](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-class-diagram).
They need you to create the class diagrams for the following objects:
- CartesianPlane
- Point
- LineSegment
- Polygon
- Triangle
- Rectangle

It is recommended that you use [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-class-diagram) but there are many other software tools that will work just as well.

Keep it simple, we have only learned that properties go up top, methods go below, `-` `+` and `#` show levels of protection, `/` is an overridden method, and inheritance has an arrow pointing _to the parent_. Look at the example diagrams provided in the lessons _and ask if you're unsure_.

### Submitting

To submit your class diagrams you can either:
- Share link(s) to your online diagrams inside a "Class Diagrams.md" file (learn how to make links in Markdown!)
- Include screenshot(s) of your diagrams in your repository. PNG, JPG, or WEBP should all work
