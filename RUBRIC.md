### Geometry Classes and Code Structure ([Part 1](./PART1.md))

|General Look-fors|Description|
|---|---|
|**Brief Overview**|The header is complete including author's name and a brief description or overview of what the program is or is _not_ capable of is included in the header of `script.js`. What is working, what is not?|
|**Code cleanliness**|The code is clean and easy-to read. It follows the formatting and spacing demonstrated in class, including proper tabbing, usage of which space, brackets, and _potentially_ any helper functions required.|
|**Code commenting**|Similar to cleanliness (above), large sections of code are given proper commenting - without going overboard and without _explaining_ the code.<br>Use of the demonstrated [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) style of commenting is _suggested_ but not _required_.
|**No errors on "Run"**|The program compiles and loads into memory when "_run_" and no errors occur on compilation. Any errors during testing are noted in the comments (see "Brief Overview", above).|
|**Objects and members match requirements**|The definitions (and names!) of classes and class members match the requirements set forth by the client. They do not stray from these designs, add any functionality, or provide extra "features". No properties, methods, or otherwise have been left out. (Private helper functions are permitted)|
|**Object Behaviour**| Within the specifications provided by the client, the code and objects interact as requested / described without error. Any errors that do occur would and should be the fault of the tester, user - not the design or functionality of the code. |
|**Easy to understand output / results**|The return values and prints to console are clear **and as requested**. No extra flare or details are provided.|
|**Testing code removed**| After testing your code (you _did_ test it, right?) remove or comment-out your testing code and calls to `console.log()` |
|**Optional Extras**|Optional level 4 or 4+ members have been coded and tested. They work according to the specifications of the program.|
|**Deadline**|The program is complete and submitted by the posted deadline.|

### Class Diagrams ([Part 2](./PART2.md))

|General Look-fors|Description|
|---|---|
|**Completeness**|Diagram(s) have been included in the code repository and are appropriately named (easy to find).|
|**Class Correctness**|Classes are properly defined, including any inheritance links.|
|**Property Correctness**|Class property members are listed correctly, with the appropriate protection symbol (+, -, #).|
|**Method Correctness**|Methods, including any _getters_ or _setters_ are properly listed along with any required protection or override symbol(s) and return types. You may wish to research how to include getters and setters in a class diagram.|
|**Deadline**|The diagrams are complete and submitted by the posted deadline.|
