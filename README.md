This is a summative assessment on your knowledge of 2D arrays and basic OOP. Read carefully and ask if you have any questions.

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Congratulations, you just got your first job as a junior programmer! 💰

Your client has requested that you create a geometry and cartesian plane application. Your job is to implement the required classes and all the members, methods, and functionality described in this documentation.

Since the front-end (graphics) will be added by someone else on the team, it is important that you follow the documentation and ensure variable names and object structure match the descriptions. Feel free to ask the client for any clarification.

> - Some testing may be provided by the client in the future, _if at all_.
> - This is _not_ closed book. Notes, examples and previous code are fine, but AI and code generation is _prohibited_.
> - Round _all_ calculated numeric values to _two_ decimal places.

#### This project consists of two parts:
1. [The Code](PART1.md)
    1. [Point](PART1.md#point)
    2. [Line Segment](PART1.md#line-segment)
    3. [Polygon](PART1.md#polygon)
    4. [Triangle](PART1.md#triangle)
    5. [Rectangle](PART1.md#rectangle)  

    _Optional_ Bonus [The Cartesian Plane](PART1.md#the-cartesian-plane-cartesianplane)

2. [The Class Diagrams](PART2.md)
